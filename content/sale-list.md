Nothing available at this time; we will have some does in milk available this year, and will be retaining a limited number of kids.

## Terms & General Sale Information

Thank you for stopping in, we are located in Sheridan Oregon, 35 miles east of Lincoln City. We are dedicated to raising top quality, healthy, and correct Nigerians striving for dairy quality.

If you would like to reserve a kid from a scheduled breeding, we request a **$50 deposit** for each kid reserved. If your selected kid is not available, you are welcome to transfer the deposit to another animal, save it for the following year, or receive a full refund of your deposit.

A $50 deposit is required to hold a breeding animal for up to 30 days. If arrangements are made in advance, we may be able to hold your reserved goat longer for a fee of $1.50 per day. All deposits on breeding animals are non-refundable but are transferable to another animal for a period of one year.

If arrangements to pick up a reserved animal are not made within 30 days, and no other arrangements are made, any deposit will be forfeited and the goat will be placed back up for sale.

We strive to send our kids to their new homes healthy and happy; we are not responsible for their health once they leave our farm.

**Buck and Wether Kids — Please Note:** We band our buck kids at 8 wks of age. All "wethers" are intact bucks until that time. We sell very few bucks — most will be sold as pet wethers.

**As the breeder, we reserve first rights on all breedings.**
