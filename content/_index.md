Welcome to **Diji Farm** — raising Nigerian Dwarf, Nubian, and Mini Nubian dairy goats since 2007 in Sheridan, Oregon.

We love showing our goats and using their milk to craft delicious cheeses and soothing soaps — sharing the bounty of our farm with others.

We are proud participants in **DHI (Dairy Herd Improvement)** and **ADGA Linear Appraisal** programs, breeding for show quality, milk production, and wonderful temperaments.

Thank you for stopping by! We hope you enjoy our little farm and our goats as much as we do.
